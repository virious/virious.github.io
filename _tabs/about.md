I always struggled with perfectionism. That led to procrastination and being afraid to do anything unless it's perfect. Of course I was too afraid to speak about it openly so my impostor syndrome had lot's of food to grow on. To fight with that, I created [my music channel](https://www.youtube.com/@virious_max). It's my place where I don't edit my music at all. Sometimes it's in sync with click, sometimes it's not. It's definitely not perfect but that's not my goal. Now I'm trying to live by saying: "Strive for progress, not perfection" but still it's easier said than done. 

To go one step further with my journey I started talking about my insecurities and issues online. Some of them I've already left behind but some of them are still with me. I hope that maybe someone will read this and feel better. Even if you found yourself in a new place in life and don't know what you're doing, you're not alone. 

This is the place where I take you on a journey. Where I share things that I've learned and things that I'm still trying to figure out. 

Enjoy!
