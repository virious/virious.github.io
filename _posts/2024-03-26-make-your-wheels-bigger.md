title: Make your wheels bigger

Yesterday I deadlifted 103.5 kg. But let me tell you a story.

Years ago, when I was young and stupi..., erm, ambitious, all I could think about was making games. Don't get me wrong, I always loved making them, but it reached absurd levels. I would program at work and then come home to program even more, all while still thinking about work-related problems. This went on for a couple of solid years, consuming my focus as I didn't have much else going on at the time.

Fast forward to today. I have a 7 year old daughter, and we do lots of activities together. We read books, write songs, or just fool around. With my wife we watch our beloved tv series that at this point we know by heart. Additionally, I play in three active metal bands that tour and play festivals.

I also lift weights three times a week. It clears my head and gives me time for myself. It not only builds my muscles but also boosts my confidence. For the majority of my life, I was a scrawny kid who was pushed around by bullies at school. Now, I strive to be big, strong, and capable of taking care of myself for my wife and daughter so they don't need to worry about me when I'm old. And, of course, I want to be prepared to keep all the boys at bay when they come around my daughter.

I used to watch the Living The Van Life channel on YouTube. It's about a guy who travels around the world in his modified Sprinter van. He once said something that stuck with me. I'm paraphrasing but he said something like: "You need to make your wheels bigger to make the terrain obstacles smaller". That's what I'm trying to do - make myself physically and mentally bigger to make life's obstacles smaller.
