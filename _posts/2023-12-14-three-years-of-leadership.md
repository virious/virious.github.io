title: Three years of leadership

This year, I had the pleasure of receiving Techland's Board Award. It was a complete surprise for me and I feel super appreciated and valued. But let me tell you a story.

Three years ago, I joined Techland. I had spent most of my game development years just programming, minding my own business and nothing else. Fixing bugs, adding new features, debugging—all that good programmer stuff. But then, an opportunity presented itself to change my career path. Now, I wasn't just a tools programmer; I was supposed to put on the leader's hat. I had no previous experience leading a team of people. During my recruitment process, I read three huge books about management, building teams, and giving feedback. I started listening to multiple leadership podcasts and reading articles—all to at least have a grasp of the idea of what I was getting myself into.

Three years have passed, and still, to this day, I'm trying to improve. I'm still learning new things. I'm still far from what a perfect lead is, although what is perfect? That's a topic for another philosophical discussion.

Being praised and recognized by your superiors is a great thing, and I did not experience it very often in my past. But now, I would like to thank all of my teammates who make my job one of the nicest jobs I could imagine having. Katarzyna Klarowicz, Piotr Zagawa, Marek Daniluk, Wojciech Czarny, Wiktor Grudzina, Patryk Komosa—all of you rock! It's the best team I could have for my first leadership role. All of you are highly organized and super friendly. Your feedback and insight make our team a really pleasant place to be. I'm super thankful for the opportunity to be your lead and for the chance to make your job easier and more streamlined.
